Executive Summary #\rGoNetZero, a decarbonization firm by SembCorp, traditionally managed the registration of REC-generating devices via manual email processes. This method resulted in processing times of 3 – 4 months, increased operational liability, and high manpower costs. Our engagement focused on designing a dedicated web form and process flow integrated within Gonetzero’s platform to enable self-registration by customers. This initiative reduced processing time to 1 month, improved data governance, enhanced customer transparency, and significantly lowered manual intervention.\nKey Metrics \u0026amp; Highlights #\rProcessing Time Reduction: From 3 – 4 months to 1 month. Operational Efficiency: Significant decrease in manhours required for registrations. Risk Mitigation: Lowered liability through improved data governance. Enhanced User Experience: Empowered customers with flexible, transparent registration. #image (Key Metrics / Highlights)\n2. Background \u0026amp; Context #\rProject Background #\rGonetzero’s operations team was burdened by a manual, email-based registration process for REC-generating devices, interfacing with APX and IREC registries. This outdated method not only slowed operations but also introduced significant risks related to data handling and compliance.\nBusiness \u0026amp; User Goals #\rBusiness Objective: Reduce operational overhead and liability by automating the registration process. User Objective: Enable a self-service model that provides customers with greater flexibility and immediate insights into their registration status. Project Scope \u0026amp; Constraints #\rScope: Design and implement a web-based registration form and process flow. Constraints: Must align with the stringent requirements of APX and IREC registries; limited historical process documentation required intensive stakeholder engagement to uncover hidden steps in the manual process. #image (Background or Process Context)\n3. Problem Definition #\rThe Core Challenge #\rThe manual registration process was inefficient, error-prone, and inherently risky. With processes managed through disparate emails, there was no standardized method to ensure data accuracy or timely processing, leading to operational delays and increased liability.\nUser Pain Points \u0026amp; Needs #\rOperational Inefficiencies: Prolonged processing times and high reliance on manual input. Customer Frustrations: Lack of transparency and control over the registration journey. Compliance Risks: Inconsistent data governance increasing the risk of regulatory non-compliance.
