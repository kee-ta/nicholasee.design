## 1. Executive Summary  
Miele is a family-owned and operated global brand founded in Germany, producing high-end domestic appliances and commercial equipment. They pride themselves on delivering premium, best-in-class products for performance, reliability, and quality. The company also emphasizes personalized customer service worldwide.  

Miele’s smart fridge application, Miele@Home, was created to help users manage their refrigerators remotely. However, it suffered from multiple usability challenges, including poor navigation, hidden features, and the lack of an inventory tracking system.  

User reviews and online sentiment towards the app were largely neutral or negative, while similar offerings from other brands were rated much higher. The goal of this redesign was to improve user retention and enhance the overall experience by reworking the application’s structure, introducing an inventory tracking system, and making key features more accessible.  

### Key Metrics & Highlights  
- Improved Feature discoverability  
- Task completion efficiency improved by 40%  
- Increased user engagement with recipes and shopping lists  
- Streamlined navigation with direct access to core functionalities

## 2. Background & Context  

### Project Background  
Miele smart devices do not feature interactive screens, so the companion app is the primary interface for users. The original app struggled with issues of usability, accessibility, and lack of necessary features.  

Research indicated that Miele’s competitors, particularly LG and Bosch, had much stronger smart appliance applications. Miele’s app lacked an inventory management system, requiring users to manually track their fridge contents or rely on memory, leading to food wastage and redundant purchases.  

### Business & User Goals  
- Improve user experience by simplifying navigation and feature access  
- Increase engagement by making the app more useful in daily life  
- Provide better inventory tracking to help reduce food waste  
- Align the app’s branding and design with Miele’s premium reputation  

### Project Scope & Constraints  
- The app redesign had to maintain Miele’s branding  
- Features had to be implemented within existing smart fridge capabilities  
- Inventory tracking needed to work with available hardware, such as in-fridge cameras

## 3. Problem Definition  

### The Core Challenge  
Miele@Home suffered from a lack of usability and engagement due to:  
- Confusing navigation, with core functions hidden behind multiple menus  
- No inventory tracking, making it difficult for users to know what they had in their fridge  
- A cluttered interface that overwhelmed users with too much information at once  

### User Pain Points & Needs  
- Feature discoverability was low, leading to frustration  
- Cognitive overload due to poor UI structure  
- Users had to rely on memory or third-party apps to track their groceries  

### Impact on Business  
Without improvements, Miele risked:  
- Losing users to competitors with more feature-rich apps  
- Low engagement with the smart fridge features  
- Negative user sentiment damaging the brand’s reputation

## 4. Research & Discovery  

### Methodology  
The research phase included:  
1. User interviews to gather qualitative feedback on existing pain points  
2. Competitive analysis of Bosch and LG’s smart appliance apps  
3. Usability testing to observe where users encountered difficulties  

### Key Insights & Findings  
- LG’s ThinQ app provided a more user-friendly smart fridge management experience  
- Bosch’s Home Connect app had an intuitive inventory tracking system  
- Users struggled to find recipes, manage groceries, and adjust fridge settings in Miele@Home  

### Personas & Empathy Mapping  
Three key user groups were identified:  
1. Enterprising Professionals: Tech-savvy individuals who value convenience and premium products  
2. Uptown Renters: Young professionals living in rented apartments who spend on lifestyle and technology  
3. Urban Families: Households with children, prioritizing convenience and efficiency in meal planning  

![Personas and Empathy Mapping](#)

### User Journey Mapping  
The existing app forced users through unnecessary steps, making tasks like checking fridge contents or finding recipes more time-consuming than necessary. The redesign aimed to streamline these workflows and prioritize frequently used features.

## 5. Heuristic Evaluation  

### Findings from Heuristic Analysis  
- User control: The app was broken into three tabs—Start, Recipes, and Profile—offering better organization  
- Accommodation: The app lacked flexibility for different user needs, such as alternative color schemes for accessibility  
- Linguistic clarity: Text on buttons and recipes was simplified to be more user-friendly  
- Aesthetic integrity: The previous black-and-orange design felt disconnected from Miele’s branding  
- Simplicity: Many unnecessary UI elements were removed for a cleaner, more intuitive experience  
- Predictability: The new design introduced consistent UI patterns for easier learning  
- Accuracy: Button differentiation was improved to reduce confusion
