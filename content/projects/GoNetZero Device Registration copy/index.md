## 1. Executive Summary
GoNetZero, a decarbonization firm by SembCorp, traditionally managed the registration of REC-generating devices via manual email processes. This method resulted in processing times of **3 – 4 months**, increased operational liability, and high manpower costs. Our engagement focused on designing a dedicated web form and process flow integrated within Gonetzero’s platform to enable self-registration by customers. This initiative reduced processing time to **1 month**, improved data governance, enhanced customer transparency, and significantly lowered manual intervention.

### Key Metrics & Highlights
- **Processing Time Reduction:** From 3 – 4 months to 1 month.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Significant decrease in manhours required for registrations.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Lowered liability through improved data governance.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Empowered customers with flexible, transparent registration.

## 2. Background & Context

### Project Background
Gonetzero’s operations team was burdened by a manual, email-based registration process for REC-generating devices, interfacing with APX and IREC registries. This outdated method not only slowed operations but also introduced significant risks related to data handling and compliance.

### Business & User Goals
- **Business Objective:** Reduce operational overhead and liability by automating the registration process.
- **User Objective:** Enable a self-service model that provides customers with greater flexibility and immediate insights into their registration status.

### Project Scope & Constraints
- **Scope:** Design and implement a web-based registration form and process flow.
- **Constraints:** Must align with the stringent requirements of APX and IREC registries; limited historical process documentation required intensive stakeholder engagement to uncover hidden steps in the manual process.

## 3. Problem Definition

### The Core Challenge
The manual registration process was inefficient, error-prone, and inherently risky. With processes managed through disparate emails, there was no standardized method to ensure data accuracy or timely processing, leading to operational delays and increased liability.

### User Pain Points & Needs
- **Operational Inefficiencies:** Prolonged processing times and high reliance on manual input.
- **Customer Frustrations:** Lack of transparency and control over the registration journey.
- **Compliance Risks:** Inconsistent data governance increasing the risk of regulatory non-compliance.

### Impact on Business
Without an automated system, Gonetzero faced mounting operational costs and potential compliance failures, hindering scalability and competitive positioning in a fast-evolving market.

## 4. Research & Discovery

### Methodology
A thorough discovery phase was initiated by identifying key stakeholders and conducting detailed interviews to map out the existing manual processes. This qualitative research was essential in understanding the intricacies and gaps inherent in the current workflow.

### Key Insights & Findings
- **Process Bottlenecks:** Critical delays identified in manual data entry and validation.
- **Regulatory Alignment:** Immediate need to standardize processes to meet APX and IREC requirements.
- **User Expectations:** Demand for a more transparent and flexible registration experience.

### Personas & Empathy Mapping
By developing stakeholder personas—ranging from Gonetzero’s operations staff to end-user customers—the team pinpointed specific needs and frustrations, informing the design strategy.

### Interaction & Micro-Interactions
Key micro-interactions—such as real-time form validation, progress indicators, and contextual tooltips—were integrated to enhance usability and reduce the likelihood of user error. These elements were pivotal in streamlining data entry and validation.

### Prototyping & Usability Testing
Multiple rounds of usability testing were conducted with both internal and external stakeholders. Feedback from these sessions was systematically incorporated, resulting in iterative refinements that improved the overall user experience and ensured compliance with registry standards.

### Design Rationale & Decision Making
Each design decision was grounded in the dual objectives of operational efficiency and regulatory compliance. The iterative testing process provided the data needed to make informed adjustments, ensuring the final design addressed both user needs and business goals.
