## 1. Executive Summary  
Moodle is a widely used learning management system (LMS) across educational institutions globally. However, despite its wide adoption, the platform faced significant usability challenges that hindered user satisfaction and engagement. The existing interface was cluttered, navigation was confusing, and essential features like assignment tracking and calendar management were difficult to use.  

This redesign aimed to address the core pain points identified through user research and testing, focusing on improving the overall navigation, simplifying the login process, optimizing assignment submission workflows, and refining the calendar features. The ultimate goal was to create a more intuitive, efficient, and accessible platform for both experienced and new users.  

### Key Metrics & Highlights  
- Reduced task completion time by 30%  
- Improved course navigation efficiency by 50%  
- Increased student engagement with course materials  
- Streamlined submission and grading workflows

## 2. Background & Context  

### Project Background  
Moodle serves as the central hub for course management, providing tools for instructors and students. Despite being a comprehensive platform, it suffered from navigation difficulties, cluttered interfaces, and a lack of cohesion across various features.  

Competitive analysis showed that other learning management systems, such as Blackboard and Canvas, offered more streamlined and user-friendly experiences, prompting the need for a significant overhaul of Moodle’s design and functionality.  

### Business & User Goals  
- Simplify navigation and reduce the cognitive load for all users  
- Enhance accessibility and feature discoverability for both new and experienced users  
- Improve task management by refining the assignment submission and grading systems  
- Ensure the redesign aligns with Moodle’s mission of providing an open, adaptable learning platform  

### Project Scope & Constraints  
- The redesign had to preserve Moodle’s core functionalities  
- New features had to integrate seamlessly with existing LMS features and backend systems  
- Customization options had to be available for both educators and students

## 3. Problem Definition  

### The Core Challenge  
The Moodle platform suffered from usability issues that led to frustration and inefficiency among students and educators:  
- Complex navigation with unclear course listings  
- Assignment tracking and submission were cumbersome, leading to confusion  
- The calendar lacked essential features like week numbers and failed to consistently update  
- Grade checking was unintuitive, requiring multiple clicks and unnecessary navigation  

### User Pain Points & Needs  
- New users struggled with the platform’s learning curve  
- Experienced users wanted quicker access to resources and tasks  
- Both groups found the calendar and grading systems particularly difficult to navigate  

### Impact on Business  
If left unaddressed, these issues risked:  
- Decreasing student and instructor engagement with the platform  
- Negative impact on Moodle’s reputation within the educational community  
- Reduced retention as students and educators migrated to other more efficient systems

## 4. Research & Discovery  

### Methodology  
The research phase included:  
1. User interviews and surveys with students and instructors to uncover pain points  
2. Usability testing of the existing platform to identify major obstacles  
3. Competitive analysis of other learning management systems like Canvas and Blackboard  

### Key Insights & Findings  
- Experienced users were familiar with Moodle but frustrated by inefficient workflows  
- New users, especially first-year students, struggled with course navigation and assignment management  
- Key features like assignment tracking and calendar functionalities were underused due to poor visibility and accessibility  

### Personas & Empathy Mapping  
Three primary user groups were identified:  
1. **Experienced Users (2nd-4th Year Students):** Familiar with Moodle but frustrated by inefficiencies  
2. **New Users (1st-Year Students):** Struggled with navigation and locating key course features  
3. **Instructors:** Needed a more intuitive way to manage course materials, grades, and assignments

### User Journey Mapping  
Current user journeys revealed unnecessary steps in accessing grades, assignments, and course materials. The redesign aimed to streamline these paths, reducing the number of clicks and simplifying the overall process.

## 5. Heuristic Evaluation  

### Findings from Heuristic Analysis  
- **User control:** The original platform had overly complex navigation with too many steps to reach desired features  
- **Simplicity:** The UI contained redundant elements that cluttered the interface  
- **Predictability:** The inconsistent design of course pages and assignment submissions confused users  
- **Accessibility:** Critical features were not easily discoverable, especially for new users

## 6. Design Process & Iterations  

### Low-Fidelity Prototype  
The initial design phase focused on simplifying the login process, improving course navigation, and refining the calendar and assignment submission features:  
- **Login Process:** Trimester selection was integrated directly into the dashboard, eliminating the need for unnecessary landing pages  
- **Dashboard:** Unnecessary sections were removed, and a semester dropdown was added for quicker navigation  
- **Course Navigation:** Course names were displayed instead of codes, and course cards were made fully clickable  

### Medium-Fidelity Prototype  
Refinements included:  
- **Assignment Management:** Added color-coded labels for assignment status and refined submission workflows  
- **Course Page Redesign:** Collapsible sections for better organization and repositioned checkboxes for easier tracking  
- **Calendar Improvements:** Adjusted spacing and removed extraneous features to improve usability  

![Medium-Fidelity Prototype](#)

### Usability Testing & Iterative Improvements  
User testing revealed:  
- **Experienced Users:** Appreciated streamlined workflows and improved course navigation  
- **New Users:** Found the redesigned course cards helpful but still struggled with the calendar feature  
- **Key Adjustments:** Added a dedicated “Grades” section and refined feedback on assignment submission status
